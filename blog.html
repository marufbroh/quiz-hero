        <h1>1. What is the deference of map, filter, forEach, find method?</h1>
        <p><b>Answer: </b>map and forEach:-Map is a function which apply only on array. That's why its called an array
            method . map task is so simple. It takes an array and create a new array by manipulating each element of an
            existing array. It can't change original array . And forEach function exactly do the same work. Both do loop
            through an array . But map function returns the array and forEach doesn't return anything. That's the basic
            deference of Map and forEach function.</p>
        <p>filter and find:- This two also is an array method . Filter and Find usually use for to loop through an array
            but based on a condition . If required condition match for the target array than Filter and Find function
            show this results. However, they have different use cases and return different results. Filter method
            returns a new array but didn't change original array . it's made a array by itself and return this array
            also . On the other hand, Find method returns only the first element in an array which is matched the given
            condition. That's the basic deference of Filter and Find function.</p>

        <h1>2. What is the deference of Local Storage ,Session Storage, and Cookies?</h1>
        <p><b>Answer: </b>Local storage, session storage, and the cookie three are web APIs. They are only available on
            certain browsers, like Chrome and Brave. <br> <br>
            Local storage:- Local storage is the Web Storage API, where we can store some data on the client's computer
            in the form of key-value pairs in a web browser. This data has lifetime access in the browser unless we
            delete or remove it. This data doesn't disappear even when the user closes his browser. It helps a developer
            improve the performance of a website. <br> <br>
            Session storage:- Session storage is the same as local storage. The default is that local storage data is
            deleted when the user closes his browser or tab. Although local storage saves his data forever, That's the
            basic purpose of this storage. <br> <br>
            Cookie:- A cookie is a small text file that is stored in your computer's browser. Its maximum size can be 4
            kilobytes. They are commonly used for user authentication, tracking user activity, and personalizing
            content. Through cookies, a website can recognize and understand a user's behavior and use that information
            to improve the user's experience. In cookies, the developer can be given an expiration date or set to
            expire. Otherwise, it will be considered a session cookie and will be deleted when the user closes his tab
            or browser.</p>
