        <h1>1. What is the deference of map, filter, forEach, find method?</h1>
        <p><b>Answer: </b>map and forEach:-Map is a function which apply only on array. That's why its called an array method . map task is so simple. It takes an array and create a new array by manipulating each element of an existing array. It can't change original array . And forEach function exactly do the same work. Both do loop through an array . But map function returns the array and forEach doesn't return anything. That's the basic deference of Map and forEach function.</p>
        <p>filter and find:- This two also is an array method . Filter and Find usually use for to loop through an array but based on a condition . If required condition match for the target array than Filter and Find function show this results. However, they have different use cases and return different results. Filter method returns a new array but didn't change original array . it's made a array by itself and return this array also . On the other hand, Find method returns only the first element in an array which is matched the given condition. That's the basic deference of Filter and Find function.</p>
